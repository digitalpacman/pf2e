TTRPG Third Party Content Idea Plan

I want to create a site for people to find, buy, and use third part content.
Not only third party content, but first party content as well.
The idea is to merge it all together.
Users will have access to posted free 3rd party content, as well as first party.
The monetary part is when 3rd party content creators upload their content as paid.
Each user will pay a monthly subscription for tokens, and spend the tokens on gaining access to author content.
Users will continue to use the site because of the integration of all their content and resources in one place.
For example:
  A monster search of all first party content, free content, and any paid resources they subscribed to.
  They can use a monster builder that has it all in.
  During a game, they can use the app to view and play the monsters, including all content they have access to.

The token system influences authors to create more content so that they are the one people subscribe to.
We take a cut of the subscription and pay out to content creators based on how many tokens were spent on their content.

To start I'm looking to do monsters. Monthly service to access all 3rd party content until the marketplace grows.
Other 3rd party content that's marketable are add-ons to TTRPG apps like VTT Foundry, and roll20.
Or modules built to be imported. Such as custom made versions of paizo content.
Monster tokens. Player tokens. Written campaigns. Anything.
We could have entire campaigns built in our own system outside of PDFs, with an amazing interface for running games.
