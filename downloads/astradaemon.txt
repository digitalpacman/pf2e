<div class="special-abilities">
<p><b>Soul Siphon</b> (aura, divine, force, necromancy) 30 feet. An astradaemon draws power from the souls of the recently slain. If a Small or larger living creature dies within its aura, the astradaemon gains 5 temporary Hit Points and a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 1 round, unless the creature was slain by an astradaemon&#8217;s Devour Soul ability. Incorporeal undead and living spirits traveling outside the body take 1d8 force damage each round within the daemon&#8217;s aura from the spiritual pressure as the astradaemon pulls in fragments of their soul.</p> 
<p><b>Displacement</b> (divine, illusion, visual) An astradaemon bends <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/light/">light</a>, appearing shifted from its true position, though still in the same space. Creatures targeting the astradaemon must attempt a DC 11 flat check, as if the astradaemon were hidden, even though it remains observed. Effects such as the Blind-Fight feat and halfling&#8217;s keen eyes that apply on the flat check against hidden creatures also apply against a displaced astradaemon.</p>

<div class="special-abilities">
<p><b>Devour Soul</b> [one-action] (divine, incapacitation, necromancy) <b>Requirements</b> The astradaemon hasn&#8217;t used an action with the attack trait yet this turn. <b>Effect</b> The astradaemon draws out and consumes the soul of a living creature it has grabbed. The creature must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or instantly die. If it dies, the astradaemon gains 10 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 1 minute, or for 1 day if the victim was 15th level or higher. A victim slain in this way can be returned to life normally. A creature that survives is temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p> 
<p><b>Essence Drain</b> (divine, necromancy, negative) When an astradaemon hits with its claw, jaws, or tail, it drains the target&#8217;s spiritual and vital essences. The target takes 2d10 negative energy damage and the astradaemon regains an equal number of Hit Points. The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude save or become doomed 1 and drained 1. If the target was already drained or doomed, it instead increases both conditions&#8217; value by 1, to a maximum of 4.</p>

<p class="header">About</p>
<p>These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct assault against a soul or life-force—the same numbing death they bring with their fell touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There, they capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or punishments and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters.</p> 
<p>These horrifying predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of the River of Souls in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims.</p> 
<p>Psychopomps have a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes between them and these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff of legend.</p>
