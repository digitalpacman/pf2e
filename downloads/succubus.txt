 <p><b>Rejection Vulnerability</b> As succubi are beings of pure lust, creatures that reject their lust can metaphysically harm them. When a succubus fails a <a href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/rules/skills/#Diplomacy_Cha">Diplomacy</a> check to Embrace or Request, or when a creature succeeds at its save against a succubus&#8217;s mental spell or ability, the succubus takes 2d6 mental damage. For one hour after causing mental damage to a succubus in this way, a creature can deal 2d6 mental damage to the succubus with a successful <a href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/rules/skills/#Demoralize_one-action">Demoralize</a> incorporating its rejection.</p>

 <p><b>Change Shape</b> [one-action] (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The succubus can take on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn&#8217;t change their Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes, but it might change the damage type their Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).</p> 
 <p><b>Embrace</b> [one-action] (attack) The succubus attempts to Grapple a creature using their <a href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/rules/skills/#Diplomacy_Cha">Diplomacy</a> bonus instead of <a href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/rules/skills/#Athletics_Str">Athletics</a>. If the creature is willing, the succubus grapples it automatically.</p> 
 <p><b>Passionate Kiss</b> [one-action] (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) <b>Frequency</b> Once per round.; <b>Effect</b> The succubus engages a creature they have grabbed in an embrace or other act of passion to drain its vital essence. The kiss makes the creature drained 1 or increases its drained condition by 1, to a maximum of 4. The creature takes 3d6 negative damage and the succubus regains Hit Points equal to the damage dealt.</p> 
 <p>The target must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or be affected by a <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/suggestion/">suggestion</a> to submit to more actions of passion rather than trying to Escape.</p> 
 <p><b>Profane Gift</b> [three-actions] (divine, enchantment, mental); <b>Frequency</b> once per day. <b>Effect</b> The succubus on can give a willing humanoid a profane gift. That creature gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. As long as the gift persists, the succubus can communicate telepathically with the target at any distance, see through the creature&#8217;s senses, and target the creature with <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/suggestion/">suggestion</a> through the telepathic link. In addition, the creature uses an outcome one degree of success worse than it rolls on saving throws against the lust demon&#8217;s <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/suggestion/">suggestion</a>s.</p> 
 <p>A humanoid can&#8217;t have more than one profane gift at a time, and a succubus can&#8217;t grant more than one profane gift at a time. Removing the gift requires an <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/atone/">atone</a> ritual. The succubus can remove the gift as a free action to give the recipient a permanent stupefied 3 condition. A 4th-level <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/restoration/">restoration</a> spell is required to reduce this stupefied condition by 1.</p> 
 <p>A summoned succubus can&#8217;t grant a profane gift.</p> 

<p class="header">About</p>
<p>Succubi are manifestations of the sin of destructive lust, and they are the most attractive of all demons—as befits their role in seducing mortals to fall to sin. The concept of gender is fluid to a succubus, as they can adopt countless <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/humanoid-form/">humanoid form</a>s of any gender to aid in their goals. Most succubi have a feminine true form (incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a different kind of demon), but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally beautiful or handsome, but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous tail.</p> 
 <p>When disguised as a mortal humanoid on the Material Plane, a succubus whispers into the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and most destructive desires and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if persuasion fails. While mortals often fixate on succubi&#8217;s application of sexual lust, these demons are can easily exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or any other desire as easily as more carnal appetites. Their ability to infiltrate societies makes them excellent spies, assassins, and political saboteurs as well. Ultimately, the succubus enjoys all means of upending mortal culture.</p>
