 <p><b>Attack of Opportunity</b> [reaction]</p> 

<div class="special-abilities">
<p><b>Double Opportunity</b> A baomal gains an extra reaction each round that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity. It must use a different head for each one it attempts, and it can&#8217;t make more than one Attack of Opportunity for the same triggering action.</p> 
<p><b>Psychic Static Aura</b> (aura, divination, mental, occult) 120 feet. All creatures, except aberrations, that begin their turn in the area take 5d6 mental damage.</p> 
<p><b>Two Heads</b> Any ability that would sever a baomal&#8217;s head (such as a critical hit with a vorpal weapon) severs one head at random. Losing one head doesn&#8217;t kill a baomal, but it does prevent the baomal from making Strikes with the lost head and from using Double Opportunity or Two-Headed Strike.</p>

 <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action] jaws +38 (reach 20 feet), <b>Damage</b> 4d12+18 piercing plus Improved Grab</p>

<div class="special-abilities">
<p><b>Breath of the Sea</b> [one-action] (attack) A baomal can inhale tremendous amounts of water, drawing everything in the sea nearby closer. All creatures and objects in the water within 60 feet of the baomal (including ships) are pulled toward it. Creatures must succeed at a DC 42 <a href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/rules/skills/#Athletics_Str">Athletics</a> check or be pulled up to 20 feet toward the baomal (40 feet on a critical failure). For ships, use the captain&#8217;s Sailing <a href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/rules/skills/#Lore_Int">Lore</a> in place of <a href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/rules/skills/#Athletics_Str">Athletics</a>. Unattended objects are automatically pulled.</p> 
<p><b>Shell Rake</b> [one-action] (move) The baomal Swims or Strides alongside a creature or the hull of a vessel, dealing damage with the strong spikes on its shell. Each creature or ship the baomal is adjacent to at any point during its movement takes 6d6+10 slashing and piercing damage (DC 42 basic Reflex save). Against vessels, Shell Rake ignores the first 5 Hardness and creates an explosion of splinters that deals 3d6+5 damage to every creature within 10 feet of the deck&#8217;s edge (DC 42 basic Reflex save).</p> 
<p><b>Two-Headed Strike</b> [two-actions] The baomal makes a Strike with each set of jaws, each against a different creature. These Strikes count as one attack for the baomal&#8217;s multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn&#8217;t increase until after both attacks.</p>

<p class="header">About</p>
<p>Few sea monsters are as dreaded and feared as the two-headed baomal. These massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete with krakens and other monsters for food. They feed on whales and other large sea creatures, sometimes following them to the water&#8217;s surface. Near the surface, baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships&#8217; hulls, then leisurely feed on the helpless sailors.</p>
