<p><b>Aura of Flame</b> (aura, divine, evocation, fire) 20 feet. A foe that starts its turn in the aura takes 3d6+10 fire damage, or 6d6+20 fire damage if the balor has grabbed or restrained it. A creature that hits a balor with an unarmed Strike takes 3d6+10 fire damage, and weapons that hit a balor take 3d6+10 fire damage.</p> 
<p><b>Attack of Opportunity</b> [reaction] The balor can use Attack of Opportunity when a creature within their reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to its normal trigger. They can disrupt triggering concentrate actions, and they disrupt actions on any hit, not just a critical hit.</p> 
<p><b>Death Throes</b> (death, divine, evocation, fire) When a balor dies, their body explodes in a 100-foot aura of intense demonic flame. All creatures and objects in range take 16d10 fire damage (DC 45 basic Reflex save). Because the flame is infused with Abyssal energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures with immunity to fire use an outcome one degree of success better than what they rolled, instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity. The bodies of creatures reduced to 0 Hit Points by a balor&#8217;s death throes are completely incinerated into fine ash.</p>

<div class="special-abilities">
<p><b>Dimensional Dervish</b> A balor can cast their 5th-level innate <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/dimension-door/">dimension door</a> with only a single action.</p> 
<p><b>Dispelling Strike</b> [free-action] <b>Frequency</b> once per round. <b>Trigger</b> The balor hits a creature, object, or spell effect with a weapon Strike. <b>Effect</b> The balor casts an innate <a class="spell" href="https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/spell/dispel-magic/">dispel magic</a> on the target of the triggering Strike.</p> 
<p><b>Infuse Weapons</b> (divine, evocation) Any weapon a balor wields becomes a +3 major Striking vorpal weapon made of cold iron and silver while the demon holds it. A weapon that isn&#8217;t eligible for the vorpal Rune doesn&#8217;t gain its effects. The balor can change its evil damage to chaotic whenever it attacks. The demon can conjure a whip made of flames with an Interact action. This whip gains the same benefits as other weapons the balor wields.</p> 
<p><b>Lifedrinker</b> [free-action] (divine, Healing, necromancy) <b>Trigger</b> The balor kills a living creature that is at least 15th level. <b>Effect</b> The balor drinks the triggering creature&#8217;s life force and regains 10d8+80 Hit Points.</p> 
<p><b>Whip Reposition</b> When a balor grabs a creature with a whip Strike, they can move the creature to any space in the whip&#8217;s reach. The balor can move without ending the grab as long as the creature remains within the whip&#8217;s reach, and the balor can move the creature to any other space in the whip&#8217;s reach with an Interact action.</p>

<p class="header">About</p>
<p>When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision is the balor—a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with a flaming whip and a sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim. On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as generals or captains, and they typically command vast legions of demons. Standing at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest mortal souls—those who devoted entire lives to sins too numerous to count—can fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life.</p> 

<h3>Balor Lords</h3>
<p>Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the role of a true demon lord.</p>
